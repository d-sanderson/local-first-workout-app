# Local Workouts

A SvelteKit app for tracking workouts, with Clerk for authentication, Dexie for client-side database, Tailwind CSS for styling, TypeScript for type safety, ESLint for code linting, and Prettier for code formatting.

- **Dexie**: A client-side database that uses IndexedDB to store users' workout data locally.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling the app.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that provides type safety and better code maintainability.
- **ESLint**: A code linter that checks the code for errors and suggests improvements.
- **Prettier**: A code formatter that formats the code according to a set of rules.
